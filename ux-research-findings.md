**Application**: Natural language queries can replace complex filter and search operations.
**Evidence**: SysAid's AI chatbot shows streamlined workflows when agents access service records through conversation.

### 5. Context-Aware Personalization Essential
**Finding**: Enterprise users expect interfaces to adapt based on role, current projects, and past behavior.
**Application**: Governance requirements should surface based on user's asset portfolio and compliance status.
**Evidence**: Microsoft Purview's unified experience demonstrates single-entry point with role-based customization.

## User Persona Mental Models

### Application Manager Mental Model
- **Primary Frame**: "What compliance requirements apply to my current project?"
- **Navigation Expectation**: Project-centric organization with compliance mapped to specific assets
- **Task Flow**: Asset → Requirements → Assessment → Status

### Architect Mental Model  
- **Primary Frame**: "What standards do I need to consider for this technical decision?"
- **Navigation Expectation**: Technology/domain-based organization with cross-domain relationships
- **Task Flow**: Domain → Standards → Implementation → Validation

### Governance Manager Mental Model
- **Primary Frame**: "How are teams performing against our governance objectives?"
- **Navigation Expectation**: Oversight and reporting views with drill-down capability
- **Task Flow**: Overview → Exceptions → Analysis → Action Items

## Navigation Pattern Analysis

### Successful Enterprise Patterns
1. **Hierarchical with Cross-References**: Microsoft SharePoint's hub-and-spoke model
2. **Task-Based Workflows**: Monday.com's magic AI workflow creation
3. **Contextual Sidebars**: Notion's adaptive navigation based on content type
