- **Analytics**: User interaction tracking for testing analysis
- **Role-Based Views**: Different perspectives for each user role

## Getting Started

1. **Access the prototypes**: Open `index.html` in your browser to see the overview
2. **Individual prototypes**: Navigate to each concept's directory and open `index.html`
3. **Switch roles**: Use the role selector to test different user perspectives
4. **Track interactions**: Open browser console to see analytics data

## User Testing Scenarios

### Primary Testing Tasks
1. **Find Requirements**: Locate security requirements for a new API project
2. **Start Assessment**: Begin a compliance assessment for an existing application
3. **Compare Standards**: Compare requirements across different domains
4. **Switch Contexts**: Navigate between different user roles and assets
5. **Explore Portfolio**: Browse and filter your asset portfolio

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Discoverability**: How easy is it to find relevant information?
- **Efficiency**: How quickly can users complete common tasks?
- **Clarity**: Is the navigation structure intuitive and clear?
- **Context**: Does the navigation maintain relevant context?
- **Preference**: Which approach feels most natural for your workflow?

## Mock Data Structure

### Assets
- Various application types (APIs, web apps, mobile apps, platforms)
- Asset attributes (technology stack, hosting, data classification)
- Compliance scores and risk assessments
- Implementation status tracking

### Requirements
- **Security Domain**: Authentication, encryption, API security
- **Architecture Domain**: Design patterns, integration, API-first design
- **Quality Domain**: Testing coverage, monitoring, code quality

### Capabilities
- API Management, Data Processing, Mobile Development
- Cloud Infrastructure with maturity levels (1-5)
- Roadmap items and implementation progress

### Standards Marketplace
- Community ratings and reviews
- Adoption rates and complexity metrics
- Implementation timelines and prerequisites
- Personalized recommendations

## Analytics and Tracking

Each prototype tracks:
- **Navigation paths**: Where users go and in what order
- **Time spent**: How long users spend in each section
- **Interactions**: Clicks, searches, filters, role changes
- **User flows**: Complete task completion patterns

Access analytics data via browser console: `navigationAnalytics`

## Design Principles

Each prototype follows these principles:
- **User-Centric**: Designed around real user workflows
- **Context-Aware**: Maintains relevant context throughout navigation
- **Role-Appropriate**: Adapts content and features based on user role
- **Performance-Focused**: Fast loading and responsive interactions
- **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Consistent**: Shared visual language and interaction patterns

## Next Steps

After user testing, the insights from these prototypes will inform:
1. **Navigation Architecture**: Final navigation structure for the GRC Portal
2. **Information Architecture**: How content is organized and categorized
3. **User Experience Patterns**: Reusable interaction patterns
4. **Feature Prioritization**: Which features provide the most value
5. **Implementation Roadmap**: Development phases and milestones

## Feedback Collection

When testing these prototypes, consider:
- Which navigation approach feels most intuitive?
- Which tasks are easiest/hardest to complete in each concept?
- What features would you add or remove?
- How well does each approach match your mental model of GRC work?
- Which prototype would you prefer to use daily?

The navigation analytics will provide quantitative data to complement qualitative feedback from user testing sessions.
