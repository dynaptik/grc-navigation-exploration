# Domain-Centric Excellence Centers Prototype

## Overview

This prototype demonstrates the **Domain-Centric Excellence Centers** navigation concept for the GRC Portal. It organizes governance, risk, and compliance requirements around domain expertise areas rather than traditional functional silos.

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Pure Vanilla JavaScript** - No external dependencies or frameworks
- **Custom CSS** - All styling included inline, no external CSS frameworks
- **Web Components Pattern** - Modular component architecture using native JavaScript
- **Zero Build Process** - Single HTML file, works immediately in any browser
- **Self-Contained** - No CDN dependencies, no external scripts

### State Management
- **Centralized State** - Single state object with all application data
- **Reactive Updates** - State changes trigger automatic UI re-rendering
- **Immutable Patterns** - State updates don't modify existing objects
- **Event-Driven** - User interactions update state through event handlers

### Performance Optimizations
- **CSS Transitions** for smooth animations (progress bars, hover effects)
- **Hardware Acceleration** using transform properties for animations  
- **Efficient DOM Updates** - Minimal DOM manipulation with innerHTML updates
- **Debounced Rendering** - 150ms delay on content transitions for smoothness
- **Lazy Evaluation** - Metrics calculated on-demand when switching domains

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Console Logging
The prototype includes comprehensive debugging output:

```javascript
// Initialization logging
console.log('Initializing GRC Portal - Domain-Centric Excellence Centers');
console.log('Mock data loaded:', Object.keys(mockData));

// Interaction logging  
console.log('Switched to ${domain} domain');
console.log('Role changed to ${role}');
console.log('Dashboard rendered for ${domain} domain, role: ${role}');
```

### Debugging Steps
1. **Open Browser DevTools** - Press F12 or right-click → Inspect
2. **Check Console Tab** - Look for initialization and interaction logs
3. **Verify Load Success** - Should see "GRC Portal initialized successfully"
4. **Test Interactions** - Each tab click and role change logs to console
5. **Check Network Tab** - Should show no external requests (fully self-contained)

### Common Issues (Should Not Occur)
- ❌ **Content Flashing** - Eliminated with vanilla JavaScript approach
- ❌ **Loading Delays** - No external dependencies to load  
- ❌ **Script Errors** - Self-contained code with no external dependencies
